# CHARM-KASTr
The Crude Homemade Astronomical Reduction Module - KAST red (CHARM-KASTr)

A quick and dirty optical reduction package for Shane KAST Red data. This will be refined as necessary.

TODO:

Priority I:
Get the code working

Flux Calibration
Telluric Calibration
Output of Final Data Products

Priority II:
Get the code automated

Eventually want all steps to be automated (data in -> product out)

Priority III:
Get the code optiized

Vectorize (remove all for loops)

Priority IV:
Get the code commented and user-readable
(this may take some work)
